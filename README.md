# home-assistant-automations

Automation blueprints for Home Assistant — motion that respects the room next door, circadian scenes, and “please don’t flood the basement.”

Installed here as a git submodule at `blueprints/automation/etokheim-automations/`.  
Script blueprints live in [home-assistant-scripts](https://github.com/etokheim/home-assistant-scripts).

**Tip:** For the motion-light family, set up **Neighbor extended motion status** first, then the lights automation.

## Neighbor extended motion status

Tracks motion in the room *and* the neighbor room, exposing a simple helper state (`Motion`, `Neighbor motion`, `Clear`, …) so your other automations know what is going on.

## Neighbor extended motion lights

Classic version: turn lights on (or run actions) from motion here or next door, with timers and brightness-aware shutoff. Needs the motion status blueprint above.

## Neighbor extended motion activated lights V2.1

The upgraded motion-light blueprint: more configuration, clearer timers, illuminance thresholds, and the same “never stumble in the dark” goal — with fewer compromises.

---

## Circadian rhythm lighting

Keeps your Scene Extrapolation scene on a loop so lighting follows the time of day — stops when you turn the room off or when modifiers say “not now.” Requires [Scene Extrapolation](https://github.com/etokheim/scene-extrapolation).

## Floor heating regulator

Predictive floor-heating control for regulators without their own sensor: nudges setpoints every few minutes using trend data so you hit target temp without overshooting.

## Fire detection

Smoke or heat climbing fast? Run your notifications, TTS, or shutdown actions when detectors say something is wrong.

> **Note:** The blueprint file in this repo may need YAML cleanup before import succeeds.

## Frost detection

House getting too cold? Fire your alerts when indoor temperatures drop below your threshold (with sensible exclusions you configure).

## Leak detection

Water where it should not be? Parallel-friendly automation for leak sensors — notify, shut valves, flash lights: your call.
